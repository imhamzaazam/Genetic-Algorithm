# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithms are search heuristic algorithms that is influenced by Darwin's evolution theory. It assumes three things: 
##
1) Heredity: A process through which children receive traits of their parents. If beings survive long enough, traits are passed over to their children of their next generation.
##
2) Variations: If parents have same color, same size, same face, same every traits, then children must be identical to the parents. To evolve, there must be a variety of traits. 
##
3) Selection: Its always the survival of the fittest. The fittest are most likely to pass down their traits to the next generation.
